# Datasets

This repository contains the datasets that the AI team is currently working with or has worked with in the past. There are two folders contained within: **original** and **processed**. The former contains data taken directly from a public dataset and that has simply been packaged in a more convenient format (i.e. a consolidated archive). The latter contains data that has had some form of processing done to it by the AI team (i.e. noise filtering) to facilitate any further work that may need to be done with such data.
